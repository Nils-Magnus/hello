Hello
=====

a language interpreter by Nils Magnus (magnus@linuxtag.org)

**Hello** is a strong typed, infix-notated, object-oriented,
imperative, functional, and fictional solution specific language. It
was invented by Nils Magnus during a team event at secunet Security
Networks AG in 2004.

Language
--------

**Hello** is an interpreted language. To write code in **Hello**, you
need the Hello-interpreter available in this repository (see
Installation). The Hello-scripts can be of arbitrary length (depending
on operating system and hard disk capacity) and accept arbitrary
encoding of the source code.

Empty source code makes **Hello** to write "Hello World" to standard
output. In any other case, a slight, but society tolerated insultation
based on furry animals is issued (platform depending).

Installation
------------

The Hello-interpreter is written in C. Prerequisites are a C compiler,
the `make` and `git` utilities, and an operating system that tries to
conform to POSIX. To compile the interpreter, check out the project
and run `make`.
